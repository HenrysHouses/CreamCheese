Hope you enjoy this little pack. Was something I threw together for the March Community Art Challenge. Figured it would be fun to put on the store.

There are two different versions of the model:

-The Standard version using the Standard(specular) shader.

_The afsTREE version which used Lars Custom Tree Importer to get the ability to use the tree creator shaders for the leaves to bend.

If you have the ADvanced Foliage Shader pack than with the afsTREE version you can set the materials to use the AFS optimized shaders. Bark to Bark optimized and leaves to leaves optimized. Will look a lot nicer. 

There are 5 LOD models for each version(LOD0 inculded) and the LOD group is already setup.

The folders should be simple to navigate. 

-Materials folder for the materials.

-Models folder for the imported models.

-Prefabs folder for the setup prefabs with a subfolder for the not setup LOD models.

-Shaders folder store the tree creator shaders for the afsTREE model. 

-Textures folder for the textures including the LOD textures.

-Tools folder for scripts that I inculded for the demo scene. 

The highest texture the diffuse_LOD0 is very large. 8192*4096. If this is too large there are the lod textures which are already setup with the LOD models. You can just set the desired resolution textures you want to any material. If you want the highest texture to be 4096 then set the LOD1 diffuse to the LOD0 mateirals. If you do not use the 8192 than you can delete it. Will save some space.

You might have some problems with the tree creator shaders folder and if you do let me know.

If you have the Cutom Tree Importer in your project than when importing this pack the afsTREE model will be re-worked and will lose the setup AO. You can either re-bake the AO or remove both the Custom Tree Importer and Nature Shield folder and re-import Nature Shield first and than the Custom Tree Importer.  

If you have that or any other problems message me on the unity community (Baldinoboy) or email me at baldinoboy@gmail.com

Thank you and I hope you can use this in your project.
