  description: "Loke was displeased with the joy the gods got from throwing weapons
    at Baldr, since he received no injuries from them. He deceived Hodr, Baldr\u2018s
    blind half brother, to shoot at Baldr the only thing that could harm him, mistletoe.
    It pierced him, and he fell, dead.\r\n\n"
