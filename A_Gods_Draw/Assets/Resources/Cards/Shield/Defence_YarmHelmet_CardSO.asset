  cardName: Yarm Helmet
  description: 'The iron helmet is made of bands and plates, riveted together, with
    a simple knop at the top. Below the brow band it has a "spectacle" guard around
    the eyes and nose forming a sort of mask, which suggests an affinity with earlier
    Vendel Period helmets.
